/**
 * Assert the parse invariants that would otherwise break silently.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/verify-parse.mjs <replay-folder> [count]
 *
 * Run it after bumping @slippi/slippi-js, or after touching parse.ts. It needs a
 * folder of real .slp files; there are none in the repo and there never will be
 * (decision 1 — raw replays never leave the machine), so this stays a manual
 * script rather than anything CI could run.
 *
 * These invariants share a failure mode: they break QUIETLY. Nothing in the app
 * goes red, no build fails, and the dashboard keeps rendering plausible numbers.
 * That is the whole reason this file exists.
 *
 *   1. The header pass is a strict subset of the full parse. pool.ts shows
 *      header-only records on screen while the real parse runs behind them, and
 *      that is only defensible if a preview can never be CONTRADICTED later —
 *      it may leave a winner undetermined, never name a different one. Break
 *      this and win rates silently rewrite themselves mid-import.
 *
 *   2. The ranged header is byte-for-byte equivalent at the GameRecord level
 *      to the whole-buffer header it replaces.
 *
 *   3. The bounded-frame full parser returns the same GameRecord as the old
 *      retained-frame path, including teams matrices and per-move fields.
 *
 *   4. dropUnreadComputers still binds. It reaches into slippi-js's private
 *      fields to stop three stat computers whose output nothing reads. The
 *      guard means a shape change degrades to slow-but-correct, which is the
 *      safe direction and therefore the invisible one: a library upgrade could
 *      quietly hand back ~10% of every parse and nobody would ever know.
