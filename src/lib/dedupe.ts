/**
 * `GameRecord.id` is `path|size|mtime`. It answers "have I already parsed this
 * file?", which is what makes a folder rescan cheap — and it is the right key
 * for that job. It does not answer "is this the same game?", and the two
 * diverge as soon as a replay folder is shared or moved:
 *
 *  - copying the folder to a second machine changes every path;
 *  - Dropbox / Drive / SMB shares routinely rewrite mtimes;
 *  - re-organizing replays into per-month subfolders changes both.
 *
 * Each of those produces a second record for a game already in the cache,
 * which would inflate game counts, hours played, and win-rate denominators.
 *
 * So game identity comes from inside the replay instead. Two games cannot start
 * in the same second, on the same stage, between the same players.

 * cached under `path|partialSize|partialMtime`; the finished game then parsed
 * under a different id off the same file. gameKey() falls back to the file id
 * when playedAt is null, so the two never collapse — the fragment survives as a
 * dateless phantom inflating game counts, and no rescan can dislodge it because
 * its id is still in `seen`.
 *
 * The path ties them together: one file on disk has one current state, so a
 * null-playedAt record for a path that also has a timestamped one is a stale
 * read of it (a stale tombstone for that path is stale for the same reason).
 * Records for paths with no timestamped read at all are left alone — that's the
 * genuine pre-metadata replay of decision 8, not a fragment.
 *
 * pool.ts no longer creates these, but caches written before that fix carry them.
